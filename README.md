# Definding RESTful Routes
-Get request:for retriving info (not side effects like deliting or creating)
    *Used to retrive information
    *Data is send via query string
    *Information is plainly visible in the URL
    *Limited amount of data can be sent
-Post request: used to create things (send data / submit data as part of the request body, therefore we have more flexiility as far as how we send data!) 
    *Used to post data to the server
    *Used to write/create/update
    *Data is sent via request body, not a query string
    *Can send any soft of data (JSON)
